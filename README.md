# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Nella cartella principale del proggetto puoi eseguire:

### `yarn start`

Avvia l'App in modalità sviluppatore.\
Apri [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) per vedere l'app nel tuo Browser.

La pagina si aggiorna automaticamente ad ogni aggiornamento salvato.\
Potresti anche vedere eventuali errori nella console.

### `yarn test`

Avvia il test runner nella modalità orologio interattivo.\
Guarda la sezione al riguardo [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) per maggiori informazioni.

### `yarn build`

Builds l'App per la produzione nella cartella `build`.\
Ottimizza la build e raggruppa gli script per una prestazione migliore.

La build viene minimizzata e i nomi dei file includono gli hash.\
La tua app è pronta per essere distribuita!

Guarda la sezione al riguardo [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) per maggiori informazioni.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
